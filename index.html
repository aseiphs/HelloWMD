        <h2>INTERESTS AND HOBBIES</h2>
        <p>I like to say I am a pretty diverse person when it comes to interests and hobbies, I believe I've tried quite a number of things. I've played soccer, volleyball and have done athletics in my primary along with debate and ballroom dancing as well as music. I continued to do music in my junior school espcially singing(I joined the school choir). At some point I continued w volleyball, athletics and added tennis and long jump to the roster but being a sports girl didn't last long. I continued to join the school choir at St Joseph's as well.
In 2018 I then joined the pageant and modelling and got the tittle of <u>Junior Miss Botswana 2nd Princess in 2019</u> as well as <u>Miss Tsetsebjwe Tournament 1st Princess 2019</u>. Madam Queen Modelling Agency signed me and I've been doing runway shows for different stores ever since. I am also a fashion writer in the BAC school magazine and my other hobbies are dancing, doing charity, laughing at everything everyday and of course trying out new things.</p>
